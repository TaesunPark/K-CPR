## 📖 Project Overview


K-CPR is a smartwatch and mobile application that provides guidance and real-time feedback so that anyone can perform accurate CPR during cardiac arrest. Users can receive feedback on the speed and depth of CPR through voice and screen colors.

## 👨‍👧‍👧 Team Infomation

We are Team K-CPR. We met at the university programming club En#.

## 💡 Background


### 1. Increase in cardiac arrest patients

The cardiac arrest mortality rate has steadily
increased since 2009 and has increased by more
than 1.3 times compared to 10 years ago.

### 2. Effective CPR right away improves survival rate more than 3 times.

The cardiac arrest mortality rate has steadily
increased since 2009 and has increased by more
than 1.3 times compared to 10 years ago.

### 3. K-CPR helps CPR For cardiac arrest patients Without the help of experts

- Feedback to the speed, depth, and accuracy of chest compressions will
provide more effective feedback when performing CPR.
- According to a paper published in the international journal SCI, real-
time CPR feedback using smart devices has a significant effect on accuracy.
- we came up with a Technology that enables accurate
CPR by providing CPR guidance and Real-Time accuracy feedback.

## 👩‍💻 Project Features


## Service - Actual Mode

### 1. The smartwatch provides CPR UI

It helps people do CPR through smartwatch applications

### 2. Click the button to send and emergency text to 911

Quickly send a location and cardiac arrest to the emergency center

### 3. Provides screens and sounds to keep pace with chest compressive timing

Speed of chest compressions, beeps for timing, and ui animation effect

### 4. Increase the count by detecting pressure

When the acceleration sensor detects the strength, it increases the count to ui, which helps to determine how many times it has been pushed

### 5. Detects compression rate, provides BAD screen, sound

If you don’t fit the pressure cycle, you’ll be able to float the sound
and the warning UI. Help me set it up

## Service - Training Mode

### 1. Mobile phone push notification using Azure server and firebase

When training mode is executed in Smart Watch, it is connected to Azure server
and sends push notification request to FCM. Put a push notification on your mobile phone.

### 2. Provides detailed CPR training methods on mobile phones

You can find basic explanations about CPR such as consciousness check,
breath check, and 911 report by reading the UI and writing.

### 3. Provides real-time compression graphs with socket communication

Through socket communication with devices connected to Tizen-OS and Bluetooth,
real-time acceleration sensor value can be provided from Smartwatch to mobile phone
to monitor pressure graph in real time.

### 4. Provides chest compressive feedback

It gives feedback on whether the pressure was applied well to the tempo, whether the
century was strong or weak.
